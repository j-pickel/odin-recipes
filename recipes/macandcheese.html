    <h1>Homemade Mac and Cheese</h1>
    <img src="macandcheese.jfif" alt="This is finished Mac and Cheese">
    
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is some really good homemade mac and cheese.
        It reminds me of the mac and cheese my mom used to make.
        Her mac and cheese was the perfect combination of cream and crunch.
        I have always been searching for the way to make it just like her.
        This may not be exactly like it, but it is my best version yet.
    </p>
    <p>This recipe uses two different kinds of cheese.
        I like to use elbow macaroni, however, you can experiment with other kinds.
        I have used spiral and small shells before.
        The top is layered bith some bread crumbs to give a nice crunch mixed in.
        Milk and butter give the sauce a nice creamy texture all through.
